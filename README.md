This is the official repository for the 2-player Age of Information(AoI) Game, solved by a Game Theory approach.

## Abstract:

This paper examines a scenario of periodical status updates sent from a transmitter to an intended receiver in
the presence of an eavesdropper, modeling it as a static
game between two active rational agents, with the transmitter being able to control the rate of data packet generation and consequently the load on the network, while the eavesdropper decides on its success rate of capturing
these packets. A cost term is also considered, in association to both. We aim to provide an analytical solution to
this model, as well as a software implementation supplying numerical results. These results are later analyzed to
draw (sometimes counterintuitive) conclusions, and compared with other related contributions.
