This is the official repository for a 2-player Age of Information(AoI) Game, solved by a Game Theory approach.

## Abstract:

This paper examines a scenario of periodical status up-
dates sent from a transmitter to an intended receiver in
the presence of an eavesdropper, modeling it as a static
game between two active rational agents, with the trans-
mitter being able to control the rate of data packet gen-
eration and consequently the load on the network, while
the eavesdropper decides on its success rate of capturing
these packets. A cost term is also considered, in associa-
tion to both. We aim to provide an analytical solution to
this model, as well as a software implementation supply-
ing numerical results. These results are later analyzed to
draw (sometimes counterintuitive) conclusions, and com-
pared with other related contributions.
